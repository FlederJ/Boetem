# Boetem
Boetem!

A game with ships!
I have only a couple of Ideas for the game:
You play a boat in the golden age (~1700-1730; pirate age) (wooden, with sails, ...).
It doesn't exist a really story. You look from the top of the boats (it isn't only yours).
The place ist on the sea (where else?).

"will continue"
